# Phrase-Hunter-Word-Guessing-Game
This project uses object-oriented vanilla JavaScript to create a hangman-like game. Players use the onscreen keyboard to make their guesses. If a guess is incorrect, the player loses a life (the hearts at the bottom). The player has a total of five tries in which to guess the phrase. If they do not, a losing message is presented and they can restart the game. If they get the phrase, then a winning message is logged and they can generate a new random phrase to guess. 

The data set was generated from a text file containing more than 8,000 common English phrases (and a few of my own). I cleaned the data set to remove expressions that contained punctuation and filtered out inappropriate phrases using Java. Then the data set was imported to this project.
